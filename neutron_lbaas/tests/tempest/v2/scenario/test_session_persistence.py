        The following is the scenario outline:
        1. Boot two instances.
        2. SSH to the instance and start two servers.
        3. Create a pool with SOURCE_IP session persistence type.
        4. Create a load balancer with two members and with ROUND_ROBIN
           algorithm.
        5. Send 10 requests to the floating ip, associated with the VIP,
           and make sure all the requests from the same ip
           are processed by the same member of the pool.
        6. Change session persistence type of the pool to HTTP_COOKIE.
        7. Check that this session persistence type also forces all
           the requests containing the same cookie to hit the same
           member of the pool.
        8. Change session persistence type of the pool to APP_COOKIE.
        9. Perform the same check.
        10. Turn session persistence off and check that the requests
            are again distributed according to the ROUND_ROBIN algorithm.
