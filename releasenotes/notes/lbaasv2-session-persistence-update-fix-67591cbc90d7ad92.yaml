    CLI update does not allow clearing session_persistence.

    In the process of fixing the session_persistence
    update bug, we discovered that the CLI for updating
    LBaaS v2 pools does not allow one to clear the
    session_persistence for a pool once set. A fix for
    this is being prepared, but in the mean time, the
    following work-arounds are possible if a given
    pool's session_persistence parameter needs to be
    changed:

    * The pool can be deleted and recreated without
      session_persistence.
    * A tenant can update the session persistence by
      talking directly to the API using curl.

    session_persistence on a LBaaSv2 pool is no longer
    deleted when other pool parameters are updated via
    the CLI or API.
